# My AI Journey

This is a living notebook — a place where I record what I learn, build, and discover on my way to becoming an **AI Engineer**.  
It’s not a polished guide, just honest notes from the process of figuring things out.

## About This Space

AI is vast and constantly changing.  
These notes help me stay grounded — learning one concept at a time and seeing how everything connects.  
If you’re exploring the same path, you might find a few shortcuts here.

---

## What to Expect

Not formal tutorials. Not finished thoughts.  
Just experiments, reflections, and occasional breakthroughs — small pieces of a bigger understanding.

---

## Vision

To grow from curiosity into competence.  
To learn how intelligence can be built — and built responsibly.  
This is **the journey**, not the destination.
